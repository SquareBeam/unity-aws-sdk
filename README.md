# Unity AWS Services by Square Beam

### [Link to the Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/aws-sdk-by-square-beam-184958)

Official AWS SDK is big, heavy, and not Unity Friendly, it's using "async" which is cool for .NET, but on Unity, we will collide with the "Main Thread" problem, so to avoid this you have to build workarounds that will make life harder for developers to maintain that code.
From Developer to Developers with Love!
